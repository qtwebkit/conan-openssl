## General Information

This repository is used to build recipe from [conan-center-index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/openssl)
with options and compilers required by QtWebKit project. It contains only CI build
instructions and patches to original recipe which might be occasionally required.

Any issues related to building QtWebKit should be submitted to
[QtWebKit issue tracker](https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit/issues).
All feedback on this recipe which is not related to QtWebKit build issues should be
submitted to [upstream issue tracker](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues).

## Conan Information

Conan packages can be found in our [Bintray repository](https://bintray.com/qtproject/conan).
Primary intent of these packages is to support building QtWebKit on various platforms.
While it's possible that you can find these packages useful for different purposes,
build options and set of platforms and compilers may be changed in future without notice.
